/// @brief Defines the BSP functions which users need to implement. 
/// @details These BSP functions are called by SDK API functions. This file also defines some hardware related macros which also need to be 
/// customized by users according to their hardware platform. Most of the functions declared here should 
/// NOT be called by users' applications explicitly.  Exceptions are ::AVL63X1_IBSP_Initialize and ::AVL63X1_IBSP_Dispose, which may be
/// directly called by users' applications.
